# MIT6.S081: xv6-labs-2021
my implementation of xv6-labs-2021

## Introduction
- This is the project of [MIT6.S081: Operating System Engineering (2021 fall)](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html), and all resources needed are contained in the course website.
- xv6 is a Unix-like small operating system based on RISC-V architecture, and the aim of the project is to add some features upon given skeleton, by which we can deep our understanding of operating system mechanisms.
- Each branch focuses on a specific aspect of operating system, and as well as experiment codes, a solution-xxx.md file is provided to make the implementation steps more organized and clear.
